# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Luke, an aspiring Full Stack Developer transitioning from a career in the culinary and hospitality industry. With years of experience managing teams and operations, I've developed strong leadership, problem-solving, and organisational skills that I bring to my new focus in technology.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning at Coder Academy, completing a Full Stack Developer Bootcamp, where I am learning languages and frameworks such as:

- **HTML** and **CSS**: Focusing on responsive web design and user interface development.
- **JavaScript**: Creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
- **Python**: Utilising frameworks like **Flask** to build backend services.
- **React**: Developing user-centric front-end applications.
- **Node.js** and **Express.js**: Crafting robust server-side applications.
- **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL**: Managing databases effectively for data-driven applications.
- 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Coding, gaming and a bit of streaming

### My Journey

Throughout my previous roles in hospitality, including positions as a Head Chef and Manager, I embraced the challenge of leading teams and enhancing customer experiences. Skills such as data analysis for inventory management and implementing point-of-sale systems gave me a strong foundation in understanding systems and workflowsâ€”an asset I leverage in my coding projects.
